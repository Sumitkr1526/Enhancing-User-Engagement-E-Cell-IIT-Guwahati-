# Enhancing User Engagement for a Sustainable E-commerce Platform (EcoShop)

This project focuses on improving user engagement for EcoShop, a Gen Z–focused sustainable e-commerce startup, by addressing low session time, weak repeat purchases, and minimal social sharing.

Through user research, surveys, interviews, and journey mapping, the project identifies key friction points such as lack of trust in sustainability claims, absence of peer validation, and a static product discovery experience. Based on these insights, it proposes a community-driven solution called EcoStories — a visual, user-generated content feed that showcases real users sharing how they use eco-friendly products in daily life.
